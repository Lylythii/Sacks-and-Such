### New

- Added new patchouli entries

- Added the Mob Net to carry small mobs
- Added Hiking Boots, speeding you up and allowing you to quickly navigate though tall grass
- Added Horseshoes, allowing horses to move faster

### Changes

- Inventory interaction tooltip only shows on container items which have the feature enabled in config
- Item voiding is no longer a binary on or off for the whole container. Ctrl click a container slot to enable voiding
  for that slot. Doing so voids picked up items of that exact type only once items try to go into that slot. For example
  having the second slot enabled for voiding but the first slot empty will mean you have 2 slots before anything gets
  voided. It should feel much better than before
