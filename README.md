# Sacks-and-Such

Addon for 1.20 TNG which primarily adds sacks and similar held containers for storage of
items in TFC.

All containers are very configurable allowing you to change things such as Slot Count,
Slot Capacity, Automatic Item Pickup, the Maximum allowed TFC Item Size and more. These
containers are inspired by mods like Dank Null by p455w0rd in that their slots can exceed
the usual stack size limit. Unlike Dank Null you cannot directly place or interact with
items from within the container however Pick Block is supported. Many containers allow you
to insert and extract items from the container while it's in a slot (Like how vanilla
bundles and TFC Vessels work).

This mod also adds some other miscellaneous items such as the Hiking Boots or Horseshoes
providing QOL and increasing movement speed.

When curios is installed many of our containers can be worn and even display in world on
your player.
